How the Escrow System Works

- When a buyer places an order, the payment in Monero is held in escrow by the market.
- The vendor ships the product to the buyer.
- Upon satisfactory receipt, the buyer releases the funds from escrow to the vendor.
- If disputes arise, Black Ops provides a dispute resolution process to mediate and decide the outcome.

- Fraud Prevention: Protects buyers from losing funds if vendors fail to deliver.
